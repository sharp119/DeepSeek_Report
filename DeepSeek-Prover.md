**DeepSeek-Prover: In-Depth Research Report**

* **Introduction:** DeepSeek-Prover is a specialized series of language models from DeepSeek AI focused on the challenging domain of formal theorem proving. It is designed to automate and enhance the process of creating formal mathematical proofs, specifically within the Lean 4 proof assistant environment. DeepSeek-Prover aims to bridge the gap between large language models and rigorous mathematical reasoning, targeting complex theorem proving tasks. The models are trained on a large synthetic dataset of Lean 4 proofs and utilize techniques like reinforcement learning and Monte-Carlo Tree Search to improve their proof-finding capabilities.  
* **Model Versions:** The DeepSeek-Prover series has evolved through different versions, with the most prominent being:  
  * **DeepSeek-Prover-V1:** The initial version, serving as a foundational model for formal theorem proving. It established the effectiveness of using large language models for this task and was trained on a large synthetic dataset of Lean 4 proofs.  
  * **DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5:** An enhanced iteration of V1, incorporating several improvements in training and inference methodologies. DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 is further subdivided into:  
    * **DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-Base:** The base pre-trained model of the V1.5 series.  
    * **DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-SFT:** A Supervised Fine-Tuned version, optimized for improved initial proof generation.  
    * **DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL:** A Reinforcement Learning refined version, utilizing **Proof Assistant Feedback (RLPAF)** to guide the model towards successful proofs.  
    * **DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL \+ RMaxTS:** The most advanced version, further enhanced with **RMaxTS (Reward Maximization Tree Search)**, a Monte-Carlo Tree Search variant, to improve proof path exploration and discovery of more complex proofs.  
* **Architecture:**  
  * **Transformer-Based Language Model:** DeepSeek-Prover models are built upon a transformer architecture, like most modern large language models. The specific transformer architecture details (number of layers, attention heads, hidden size, etc.) are not explicitly detailed on Hugging Face, but they are designed to be capable of handling complex sequence generation and reasoning tasks inherent in theorem proving.  
  * **Specialized for Lean 4:** The models are specifically trained and fine-tuned to operate within the **Lean 4 proof assistant**. This means they are designed to generate Lean 4 code that represents valid steps in a formal mathematical proof. They need to understand Lean 4 syntax, proof tactics, and the formal mathematical environment.  
  * **Integration with Proof Assistant:** A crucial aspect of DeepSeek-Prover is its tight integration with the Lean 4 proof assistant. The proof assistant is used to:  
    * **Verify Proof Steps:** Generated Lean 4 code is checked by the Lean 4 proof assistant for correctness.  
    * **Provide Feedback:** The proof assistant provides feedback on whether a generated proof step is valid and whether it brings the model closer to a complete proof. This feedback is essential for reinforcement learning.  
  * **Monte-Carlo Tree Search (RMaxTS in V1.5-RL \+ RMaxTS):** The most advanced version incorporates RMaxTS, a variant of Monte-Carlo Tree Search. This is a search algorithm used to explore the space of possible proof steps. In the context of DeepSeek-Prover, RMaxTS helps the model:  
    * **Explore Proof Paths:** Systematically explore different sequences of proof tactics to find a path that leads to a complete proof.  
    * **Balance Exploration and Exploitation:** RMaxTS helps balance exploring promising but uncertain proof steps with exploiting known successful tactics.  
    * **Intrinsic Reward-Driven Exploration:** RMaxTS in DeepSeek-Prover utilizes an intrinsic reward mechanism to encourage exploration of diverse proof paths, not just those that immediately appear most promising.  
* **Training Data and Process:**  
  * **Large-Scale Synthetic Dataset of Lean 4 Proofs:** A key innovation of DeepSeek-Prover is the use of a **large-scale synthetic dataset of Lean 4 proofs**. This dataset is automatically generated from a corpus of mathematical problems, primarily from high-school and undergraduate-level math competitions.  
  * **Synthetic Data Generation Process:** The process involves:  
    * **Problem Collection:** Gathering mathematical problems in natural language.  
    * **Formalization in Lean 4:** Translating the natural language problems into formal mathematical statements within Lean 4\.  
    * **Automated Proof Generation:** Using automated theorem provers and proof tactics within Lean 4 to generate formal proofs for these problems. This automated process allows for the creation of a massive dataset of paired problems and Lean 4 proofs.  
    * **Dataset Scale:** The synthetic dataset is described as "large-scale," suggesting it contains a substantial number of problem-proof pairs, likely in the millions or tens of millions.  
    * **Dataset Enhancement in V1.5:** DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 uses an enhanced version of this synthetic dataset, potentially with improved quality, diversity, or scale.  
  * **Training Stages (V1.5):** DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 employs a multi-stage training process:  
    * **Pre-training (Base Model):** Initial pre-training on the synthetic Lean 4 proof dataset to learn the basic syntax, semantics, and proof tactics of Lean 4\.  
    * **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):** DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-SFT is fine-tuned using supervised learning on the synthetic dataset to improve its ability to generate valid Lean 4 proof steps and complete proofs.  
    * **Reinforcement Learning from Proof Assistant Feedback (RLPAF):** DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL is trained using reinforcement learning. The reward signal is derived from the **Proof Assistant Feedback (RLPAF)**. When the model generates a proof step, it is evaluated by the Lean 4 proof assistant. The feedback from the proof assistant (e.g., whether the step is valid, whether it makes progress towards a proof) is used as a reward signal to train the model to generate more successful proof strategies.  
    * **Reinforcement Learning with RMaxTS (V1.5-RL \+ RMaxTS):** The most advanced version builds upon RLPAF by incorporating RMaxTS. During training, RMaxTS is used to explore different proof paths. The model is rewarded not only for generating valid proof steps (RLPAF) but also for exploring diverse and potentially novel proof strategies, guided by the intrinsic reward mechanism of RMaxTS.  
* **Performance Benchmarks and Comparisons:**  
  * **State-of-the-Art Theorem Proving in Lean 4:** DeepSeek-Prover-V1 and V1.5 models are presented as achieving state-of-the-art results in formal theorem proving within the Lean 4 environment.  
  * **miniF2F Benchmark:** Evaluated on the **miniF2F benchmark**, a challenging benchmark for formal theorem proving in Lean 4\. DeepSeek-Prover models significantly outperform previous models, including those based on GPT-4, on this benchmark.  
  * **ProofNet Benchmark:** Also evaluated on the **ProofNet benchmark**, another challenging dataset for Lean 4 theorem proving. DeepSeek-Prover models again demonstrate superior performance compared to existing approaches.  
  * **Performance Improvement V1.5 over V1:** DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 shows substantial improvements in proof success rates and complexity of provable theorems compared to DeepSeek-Prover-V1. The RL-based versions (V1.5-RL and V1.5-RL \+ RMaxTS) achieve the highest performance, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement learning and tree search techniques for this domain.  
  * **Comparison to GPT-4:** DeepSeek AI claims that DeepSeek-Prover models outperform even large general-purpose models like GPT-4 specifically in the domain of formal theorem proving in Lean 4\. This demonstrates the value of specialized training and architecture for highly complex reasoning tasks.
