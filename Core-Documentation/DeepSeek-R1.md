**DeepSeek-R1: In-Depth Research Report**

This in-depth report provides a comprehensive overview of DeepSeek-R1, covering its architecture, training, performance, capabilities, and key features, along with relevant timelines and Hugging Face resources.

* **Introduction:** DeepSeek-R1 is presented as a "reasoning-first" AI model, emphasizing its capabilities in complex reasoning tasks across mathematics, coding, and general language understanding. It builds upon the foundation of DeepSeek-V3 and leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 model in targeted areas. A key focus is on transparency, efficiency, and open access, with the model weights being open-sourced.  
* **Model Architecture:**  
  * **Base Model:** DeepSeek-R1's architecture is based on the efficient **DeepSeek-V3-Base** model.  
  * **Mixture of Experts (MoE):** It employs a large MoE architecture with **671 billion total parameters**, of which **37 billion are activated per token** during inference. This MoE design contributes to both efficiency and scalability.  
  * **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA):** DeepSeek-R1 utilizes **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)** layers throughout its transformer architecture, replacing standard multi-head attention. MLA is designed to reduce the Key-Value (KV) cache size during inference, improving efficiency.  
  * **Transformer Layers:** The model consists of **61 transformer layers**. The first three layers are "dense LLM layers," using standard Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers alongside MLA. Layers 4 through 61 replace the FFN layer with a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** layer.  
  * **Context Length:** DeepSeek-R1 supports a **128K context length**, inherited from DeepSeek-V3-Base. This long context window enables processing of extensive inputs. The 128K context length is achieved through a two-stage extension process using the YaRN technique, starting from a 4K pre-training context.  
* **Training Data and Process:**  
  * **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Focus:** DeepSeek-R1 is primarily trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance its reasoning abilities.  
  * **Two RL Stages & Two SFT Stages:** The training pipeline involves a multi-stage process with two RL stages and two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stages.  
  * **DeepSeek-R1-Zero:** This variant is trained *purely* with RL, *without* initial SFT. This allowed researchers to observe the reasoning capabilities that emerge directly from RL. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrated strong reasoning but suffered from issues like poor readability and incoherent outputs.  
  * **DeepSeek-R1 (with SFT Cold Start):** To address the readability issues of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1 incorporates a "cold start" SFT phase. This involves fine-tuning on a small, curated dataset to improve clarity and coherence before the RL stages. Subsequent RL and refinement steps further enhance reasoning and output quality.  
  * **Distillation:** Reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 are distilled into smaller, dense models (1.5B to 70B parameters) based on Qwen and Llama architectures. This makes high-level reasoning accessible in smaller, more deployable models.  
* **Performance Benchmarks and Comparisons:**  
  * **Comparable to OpenAI-o1:** DeepSeek-R1 is designed to achieve performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 model, particularly in math, code, and reasoning tasks.  
  * **MATH-500:** DeepSeek-R1 achieves **97.3% accuracy** on the MATH-500 benchmark, slightly outperforming OpenAI-o1 (96.4%) and demonstrating strong mathematical problem-solving skills.  
  * **AIME 2024:** Scores **79.8%** on the AIME 2024 advanced math competition, showing near state-of-the-art performance.  
  * **Codeforces:** Ranks within the **top 3.7%** on the Codeforces competitive programming platform, indicating strong coding abilities, although slightly behind OpenAI-o1 in some coding benchmarks.  
  * **GPQA Diamond:** Scores **71.5%** on GPQA Diamond, slightly lower than OpenAI-o1's 75.7%, suggesting OpenAI-o1 has an edge in general knowledge question answering.  
  * **MMLU:** Achieves **90.8%** on MMLU, a general knowledge benchmark, again slightly behind OpenAI-o1 (91.8%).  
  * **SWE-bench Verified:** Scores **49.2%** on SWE-bench Verified, slightly outperforming OpenAI-o1 (48.9%) in software engineering tasks.  
  * **Cost Efficiency:** DeepSeek-R1 is noted for its cost efficiency in training and operation, achieving comparable performance to o1 with significantly lower computational resources and training costs (estimated $5.58 million training cost compared to OpenAI's billions). API pricing is also significantly cheaper than ChatGPT.
